        <h2>The Dough</h2>
        <img src="images/PizzaDough.webp" alt="Dough" class="pizzadough">
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="measurements">1 Cup</span> Warm water</li>
            <li><span class="measurements">1 teaspoon</span> Active dry yeast</li>
            <li><span class="measurements">1 teaspoon</span>   Honey</li>
            <li><span class="measurements">2&frac12; Cups</span> Flour (I use Big J Milling Co. Bakers flour but AP or 00 Pizza flour works great too!)</li>
            <li><span class="measurements">1 Tablespoon</span> Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To the warm water, add the yeast and honey. Stir to dissolve and allow mixture to sit for 3 minutes to ensure the 
                yeast is still alive. It should foam and start to bubble
            </li>
            <li>Place the flour and salt in the bowl of an electric stand mixer (you can do this by hand but a stand mixer makes a huge 
                difference). Add the yeast and water mixture to and mix on low speed until the miture starts to come together. 
            </li>
            <li>Increase the speed to medium and continue mixing. At this point the dough should pull away from the sides of the bowl
                but should remain slightly sticky at the bottom. Adjust water or flour in small increments depending on the dough until 
                this consistency is reached. The dough should mix for around 8 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>Once the dough has finished mixing coat your hands in a bit of olive oil and form into a ball. Transfer the dough to bowl 
                coated in olive oil and cover with a towel. Allow to rise for one hour if you are preparing the night of or you can place in 
                fridge for 1 to 3 days and allow to ferment which adds a great flavor to the dough (If choosing this option bring to room temp
                before baking).

        <li>
            Begin with a pan on medium heat.
        </li>

            To the pan add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan. 
        </li>
        <li>Add your onions and a pinch of salt and pepper. Sweat your onions until translucent.</li>
        <li>Once onions are translucent add your garlic and continue cooking for 30 seconds to 1 minute or
            until fragrent.
        </li>
        <li>Add your red pepper flakes and allow the flakes to bloom in with the oniions and garlic for approx. 30 seconds</li>
        <li>Add crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce. You can fill your cans with a little bit of water to clean them 
            out and add that to the pan as well. 
        </li>
        <li>Add the rest of your dried herbs to the sauce and bring to a simmer</li>
        <li>Lower the heat and continue to cook on low stirring occasionally until the tomatoes begin to sweeten. 
            At this point taste and adjust for salt. 
        </li>
        <li>Once your sauce is complete you can begin to assemble pizzas</li>

            <li>The dough from above or any store bought dough if desired</li>
            <li>The sauce from above or any canned pizza sauce will do</li>

        <ul>
            <li>45 minutes before you are ready to bake preheat your oven to 500 degrees Farenheit preferably with a pizza stone inside</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper for easy transfers, roll out your dough to the desired size. If you do not have a pizza
                peel I would suggest adding this to a lightly oiled lasagna pan for a more Detroit style pizza.
            </li>
            <li>Add a generous layer of the pizza sauce to the dough</li>
            <li>Top with Mozzarella cheese first then whatever toppings you've chosen</li>
            <li>Carefully transfer your pizza to the baking/pizza stone and bake for 16-18 minutes or until the edges
                begin to turn dark brown and the cheese begins to golden. 
            </li>
            <li>Remove from oven and if using a lasagna pan transfer to a wire rack to cool and avoid the crust getting soggy</li>
            <li>Slice into individual servings and serve</li>
