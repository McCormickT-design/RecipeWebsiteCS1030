        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
        <img src="images/SundayGravy.jpg" alt="Sauce" width="300" class="sauce">
            <li>Start with your cans of whole peeled tomatoes and either crush them with your hand or add them to a blender
                and blend until mostly smooth. Does not have to be perfect. Set aside for now.                
            </li>
            <li>In a large pot on medium-low heat add your oil</li>
            <li>Once the oil is glistening add your pork ribs and cook on each side to get a nice brown crust. 
                Remove to a plate on the side for now. They don't need to be cooked all the way through as they'll continue cooking in the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>Continue with the italian sausages in the casing and cook until browned on all sides adding more oil 
                if needed. Again remove from the pot to the plate with the ribs.
            </li>
            <li>Now add the sausage that was removed from the casing and break up with a spoon. Continue cooking 
                until browned. 
            </li>
            <li>To the pot add the minced garlic and torn basil and saute until fragrant. </li>
            <li>Once cooked add the tomatoes you crushed and the tomato sauce. Be sure to scrape the bottom
                of the pan with a wooden spoon to free the fond from the bottom of the pot.
            </li>
            <li>Add the rest of the dried herbs and stir to incorporate</li>
            <li>Add the meatballs from earlier, the sausages and the pork ribs back to the pot. </li>
            <li>Bring to a boil then lower the temp and simmer for at least 3 hours but the longer the better. The 
                ribs should be falling off the bone. 
            </li>
            <li>Serve over your favorite type of noodle and enjoy.</li>
        </ul>
