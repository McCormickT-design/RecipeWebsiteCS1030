        <h2 class="intro">I love food!!!!</h2>
        <img src="images/food.jpg" alt="food" class="food">
        <p>Ever since I was a child growing up in an Italian household, the love language in my house 
            has always been food. Growing up, I was never allowed in the kitchen; that honor was always 
            reserved for my mother. Even when I cooked food for myself or my friends, my mother would usher 
            me out or correct the way I was doing something to the point that I would give up or not even 
            try if she was around. Once I moved out and in with my now-wife, I realized my passion for 
            cooking and have developed a bit of a knack for it. I love to cook, and as a fat man, I love 
            to eat. I have a recipe book with hundreds of recipes that I have tried over the years, and these 
            are some of mine and my wife's favorites. These recipes are adapted from content creators and food 
            bloggers that I have found on the internet, and credit will appear in the footer of each recipe.
             If you decide to try one of these recipes, reach out and let me know what you think. Enjoy!
